## Final-Year-Group-Project
# Sorting Visualizer
Hello there! Our final year group project "Sorting Vizualizer" is a learning tool that is designed to cater to the needs of curious learners and inquisitive computer science enthusiasts to learn sorting techniques on the go! 

Unlike traditional methods of learning, our Sorting Vizualizer tool enables a learner to 'visualize' while they learn. A learner therefore gets to join the dots in an easy and entertaining way. 
# Design Fundamentals
This project has been made with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has been deployed using Netlify. 

# A Quick User-Friendly Guide 
When you open the webpage, you will find options to customize the following:
- Enter length of array[this represents the number of bars]
- Enter custom values(comma separated)[this is where you enter the elements separated by commas]
- Select animation speed[you choose the speed of the animation to be vizualized]
- Pause button[this helps to pause the current sorting algorithm before you decide to switch to a new one]

# Sorting techniques in a few words: <Sorting basically means logically arranging data, either in ascending or descending order>

# Bubble Sort:
An algorithm that allows you to sort elements in a list by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in wrong order. As the name suggests, larger elements "bubble" to the top of the data set. 

# Insertion Sort:
An algorithm that virtually splits the given array into sorted and unsorted parts, then the values from the unsorted parts are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part. 

# Merge Sort:
Merge Sort sorts a collection by breaking it into two halves(divide and conquer strategy). It then sorts those two halves and merges them together. 

# Quick Sort:
It sorts the entire list of items by choosing a pivot element and arranging the elements around the pivot. Elements greater than the pivot value are placed to the right and vice-versa. 

# Selection Sort:
It finds the smallest element in a list or collection, and puts it at the beginning of a new sorted list. It continues to find the smallest possible element, then adds it to the new sorted list of elements.
